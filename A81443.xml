            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Nay more then this can I doe, and have done, at the Ia≈øt generall meeting at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> I hired <hi>Arthur Shuttle</hi> a Procters Clerk to go into Long-lane and procure an Aldermans gowne, and come to <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> though it was ≈øo narrowly looked to, to get in, and there by his meanes to beget a faction, and ≈øo a tumult, and at length to have faln to blows among≈øt your ≈øelves, that our Army in the meane time might have come in and plaid their part to the purpo≈øe. It was I that cau≈øed that mercinary fellow <hi>Robert Blague</hi> to write letters of intelligence between both Armies, and for his reward he had 50. pound a moneth from each Army: I per≈øwaded <hi>Blague</hi> to give intelligence to the Earle of E≈ø≈øex in what part of the army the Kings be≈øt Regiment was placed, and in what place the Lord Generall would bee at the fight, and where the Kings Standard would be placed.

               <p>I advi≈øed Mr. <hi>Ma≈øton</hi> who is the Earl of <hi>Carnarvans</hi> Chaplain to make that book which our army do ≈øo hug and laugh at, called the <hi>Complaint to the Hou≈øe of Commons:</hi> I put it into ≈øome of the malignant Citizens heads, as your Ma≈øters call them, to ≈øurprize the Tower, and to get al the Ordnance into their po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion: but that failing, I have ≈øhewed them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øtratagem how to be revenged on the City for their Robellion; you may ≈øee <hi>Pepper</hi> what power and skill I have in magicke Spells; Nay though the Gentleman did preach not above a week before the Hou≈øe of Commons, but his Sermon being not liked, and he little or no thanks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtowed on him, I wi≈øhed him to write that invective book: I have done divers of the≈øe exploits, and have many more plots yet undi≈øcovered.</p>
